# Cybersecurity Threat Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify cybersecurity threats using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is a network intrusion detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains various network traffic features labeled as normal or attack traffic. The goal is to build predictive models that can effectively detect malicious activity in network data.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Network Intrusion Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection)
- The dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical features representing network traffic characteristics.
- The target column specifies whether the traffic is **normal** or an **attack**.

## Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib tensorflow
